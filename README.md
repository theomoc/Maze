# In this application, I implemented a JavaFX application that programmatically solves, and visualises, mazes using an UML diagram. This project was uploaded from my personal Gitlab.

The MazeDriver class is a Java application used during the development
process. It is used to print Maze and RouteFinder state to the
console/terminal.
